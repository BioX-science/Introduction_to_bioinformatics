# INSTRUCTIONS

There are 3 segments with around 10 questions each that increase in difficulty. Fill in the answer within the code chunk. When you wish to test the code chunk, press the *green play button* on the right side of the code chunk to see your output. 

The hints will guide you what functions are required. You can access further information with *?x* where x is the function name, e.g. ?print().

Also check [this page](https://juba.github.io/tidyverse/10-dplyr.html), specifically sections 8.3 and 10.2 for additional help.
